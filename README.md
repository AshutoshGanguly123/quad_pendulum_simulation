# quad_pendulum_simulation
Chaotic systems are highly sensitive to ther initial conditions, are topologically transitive and generally non-periodice dense orbitted.
This code generates visualisations of double and quad pendulums, it also traces the path for it. 
Feel free to change the initial conditions i.e theta(angle of pendulum string with y axis), omega(angluar velocity) to generate visuals for its motion.
